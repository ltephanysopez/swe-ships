  <p class="current-about-p"> A problem many Computer Science and Computer Engineering students encounter is the difficulty while
     searching for internship opportunities that fit their skillset; many of us do not know where to
     search for listings, or do not know if we are suitable for the position.
     <br/>
     To solve this problem, we've created Sweships- a job searching service that gives you access to dozens
     of internship listings targeted towards Computer Science and Computer Engineering students at UTRGV.
     Our service allows users to create a profile, customize their account with skills and programming
     languages they're most experienced with, and view internships from 200+ listings in our database
     that are most relevant for you.

      the website's functionalities are described in detail below:</h5>
      <br/>
      <h4>FREE USERS</h4>
      <p> To view the top listings in your database, you'll need to create an account with your <b>UTRGV</b>
         email. After successfully signing up, you will be able to see our ten great opportunities currently
         open under <b>"Internships"</b>, and have the chance to upgrade to Premium.
      <br/>
      <h4>PREMIUM USERS</h4>
      For a better experience, free users can <b>upgrade</b> to become a Premium user by paying a one-time fee of 5 USD.
      Premium users can create a personal profile and:
      <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>Input their name</li>
        <li>Add their skills and qualifications (e.g. C++, HTML, Ruby)</li>
        <li>Specify their desired location to intern in (state)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can always come back and edit your profile if you need to make any changes. <br/>
        As a Premium user, you'll be matched with internship opportunities where only internships that require
        your skills and abilities, as well as your preferred location, will be displayed. <br/>
        From there, you can just click on <b>Apply</b> and automatically be taken directly to the application.
